\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this work, we presented a novel technique to align segmentation
hierarchies. We proposed a method to learn and predict the scale of
segments. We formulated the scale prediction for the segments in
a hierarchy as a graph label problem, which is solved by dynamic
programming. With the labeled scales as constraints, we then re-align
the segmentation hierarchies by stretching the UCM maps. The method
is evaluated on four different segmentation hierarchies on BSDS500, and it
consistently improves their quality.  We also showed
that the improvement of segmentation hierarchies by our alignment is
reflected well to a higher-level task of getting object segmentations.
